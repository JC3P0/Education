These questions are taken from Chapter 11 of our textbook:

15.    The class  Stuff  has both a copy constructor and an assignment operator ( = ).  Assume that  blob  and  clump  are both instances of the  Stuff  class.  For each of the statements below, indicate whether the copy constructor or the assignment operator will be called.  

  a) Stuff blob = clump ;
	ANSWER = copy constructor

  b) clump = blob ;
	ANSWER = assignment operator ( = )

  c) blob.operator=(clump) ;
	ANSWER = assignment operator ( = )

  d) showValues(blob) ;       // blob is passed by value  
	ANSWER = copy constructor
 

24.    Assume a class named  Bird  exists.  Write the header for a member function that overloads the  =  operator for that class.
	ANSWER = Bird &Bird::operator=(const Bird &original)

28.    Assume a class named  Collection  exists.  Write the header for a member function that overloads the  [ ]  operator for that class.
	ANSWER = char &Collection::operator[](int i)
