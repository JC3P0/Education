Fill-In-The-Blank Questions (10 points)

These questions are taken from Chapter 12 of our textbook:

1. A(n) ________ is represented in memory as an array of characters with a null terminator.
ANSWER = C-string

2. The ________ header is required before the library of C-string functions can be used in a program.
ANSWER = #include <cstring>

3. A(n) ________ is written in your program as a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.
ANSWER = String literal

4. The type ________ is used by the compiler as the type of a string literal.
ANSWER = char*

15. The ________ function returns the value of a string converted to an integer.
ANSWER = stoi(), atoi()

18. The ________ function converts an integer to a string.
ANSWER = str(), to_string()

19. Write a function whose prototype is:

  char lastChar(const char *str)

and that takes a non-empty C-string as a parameter and returns the last character in the string.  
For example, the expression   lastChar("abc")  would return the character  'c'.  
Do not use a  string  or any functions in the  string  class.
ANSWER = 
char lastChar(const char *str){
    while(*str != 0){ //go to '\0' so we can reverse by 1 for last char
        //cout << "test str: " << str << endl;
        str++; 
    }
    str--; //back 1 to last character
    return *str; 
}
