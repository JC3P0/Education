ANSWER = pure virtual

8)    A base class pointer needs a(n) ___ to be assigned to a derived class pointer.
ANSWER = type cast

11)   If every C1 class object can be used as a C2 class object, the relationship between the two classes should be implemented using ___ .
ANSWER = inheritance

13)   The keyword ___ prevents a virtual member function from being overridden.
ANSWER = final

14)   To have the compiler check that a virtual member function in a child overrides a virtual member function in the parent, you should use the keyword ___ after the function declaration .

Suppose that classes  Dog  and  Cat  derive from  Animal,  which in turn derives from  Creature.  Suppose further that  pDog,  pCat,  pAnimal,  and  pCreature  are pointers to the respective classes.  
Finally, suppose that  Animal  and  Creature  are both abstract classes, but  Dog  and  Cat  are not abstract.

15)     Will the statement:

	Animal a ;

	compile? If not, why not?

ANSWER = no, animal is abstract

16)     Will the statement

	pAnimal = new Cat ;

	compile? If not, why not?

ANSWER =  no, animal is base class to Cat

17)     Will the statement

	pCreature = new Dog ;

	compile? If not, why not?

ANSWER = no, Creature is base class to Dog 

18)     Will the statement

	pCat = new Animal ;

	compile? If not, why not?

ANSWER = yes
