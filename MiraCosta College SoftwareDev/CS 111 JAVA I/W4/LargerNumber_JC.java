/*
Write a Java program containing three methods, Main method, a Larger method to compare the entered values and return which value is larger and a third method CompareThree, which will compare three values and return the larger of the three. Make sure within the CompareThree method you are calling the larger method, do not repeat the code. 

HINT: you can place a method call inside of another method call.
First pass two hard coded values in larger method and compare which one is larger, display the result. Then let the user enter in two values, pass in the user inputted values to larger method and compare which one is the larger, display the value. Then hard code three values, call the compareThree method, pass in the 
hard-coded values, compare which one is the larger value and display the result. 

MUST create main() method, larger(with two parameters), 
and compareThree(with three parameters) â€“ within the 
compareThree method, call larger() and compare the value, 
use the HINT given. DO NOT rewrite the same code you have in 
larger in the compareThree() method

IPO chart, algorithm, code and comments required for full 
credit.

Expected Results: 

The larger of 5.6 and 10.8 is 10.8
Enter two numbers: 34 43
The larger of 34.0 and 43.0 is 43.0
The larger of 23.5, 34.6 and 12 is 34.6
